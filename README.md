# ChatGPT for desktop

This is a simple app that makes ChatGPT live in your menubar.

You can use Cmd+G (Mac) to quickly open it from anywhere.

This is a fork of Vincelwt's version. Since I don't have an Apple developer account, I can't provide you with the .dmg file. 
Additionally, his version does not include GPT-4, but this version does.
